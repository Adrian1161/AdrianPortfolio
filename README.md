## Self-assessment
I first started to learn computer science around 2022 and since then I have learned a lot about the field of computer science. I have learned how to work in multiple languages. Those being Python, JavaScript, and C++. I have also learned to work in databases management systems. The ones I am most familiar with are MySQL and MongoDB. As I have worked on more projects for school some of those projects have required that I look at stakeholder feedback and use it to create software that meets their needs. This required me to be able to properly take in feedback and understand it so that I could best meet their needs. Along with this I have become very familiar with how to have proper data structures. Databases are another thing I have worked on. I had to create a project that involved implementing a database into a program that allows users to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. To add more to this, I have a project that had me build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. This project was also connected to a database that was used for storing user profiles and booking history. This application was built using JWT for user authentication in order to add some security.

## Projects

  Text Based Game
- This is a text based game that involves going through rooms and collecting items to take down zeus.
- [IT-145 Repository](https://github.com/Adrian1161/IT-145)
- [Code review](https://youtu.be/yAwPEr1xpZg)
- Enhancements for this project are going to be add a better game menu, convert the program into c++, and add a database to store player game progress so they can continue where they left off at. I want to add a better menu the original one I created is not the best but with the new skills I learned I can improve it. So one of the big problems I have with it currently is that you have to type go [north, east, south, or west] to go a certain direction. I want to make this more simple to avoid any issues that may come up for example, the user makes a typo. The next thing I want to do is move the program over to c++ so that I can show that I understand how both of these languages work. Also most of my recent work has been in c++. The last is to implement a database to save player progress

 ## Other Projects
  Intelligent-Agent 
  - This project had me create an agent that would be thrown in a enviroment that it would have to learn how to navigate. I did this by setting up a Q-Learning algorithm so the agent could decide what the best choice at the time would be.
  - [CS-370-intelligent-agent](https://github.com/Adrian1161/CS-370-intelligent-agent)
    
  Fullstack with MEAN
  - This project is had me create a fullstack application that was used for a travel agency. The project required me to set up a way for users to create an account in order to book trips.
  - [CS-465](https://github.com/Adrian1161/cs465-fullstack)

  Weight tracker app
  - This is an android app that tracks users weight and informs them once they reached their goal weight.
